Project dependencies should be stored in a globally defined directory, so there is just one copy of a dependency on a machine and no need to have the same copy in every projects node_modules directory. Inside the projects node_modules directory, symlinks forward to the globally defined store.

This is what I expecting, let’t have a try. Oh and by the way if that sounds like pnpm, yeah it looks really similar. When starting the project, I haven’t really had a look around what is there and few days later come across pnpm and that really sounded familiar with what I am working on. 

But I will have a try anyway. Nice project to work on.
